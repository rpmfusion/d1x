  <description>
    <p>
     Descent is a classic first person shooter. You control a space-ship which
     is flying through a mine where the AI controlled robots have gone rogue.
     Your task is to fight the robots and rescue the human workers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Descent is the first game featuring a full 3D environment. In Descent
     you control your space-ship with six degrees of freedom movement.
    </p>
    <p>
     This version of Descent comes with the shareware version of the game.
     If you want to play the full (registered/commercial) version of the game,
     place the descent.hog and descent.pig data-files from your registered
     Descent version in /usr/share/d1x/full; or in $HOME/.d1x-rebirth.
