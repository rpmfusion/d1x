    <p>
     Descent 2 is a classic first person shooter. You control a space-ship which
     is flying through a mine where the AI controlled robots have gone rogue.
     Your task is to fight the robots and rescue the human workers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Descent 2 is the sequel to the classic Descent, the first game featuring a
     full 3D environment. In Descent 2 you control your space-ship with six
     degrees of freedom movement.
    </p>
    <p>
     This version of Descent 2 comes with the demo levels of the game.
     If you want to play the full (registered/commercial) version of the game,
     place the alien1.pig, alien2.pig, fire.pig, groupa.pig, ice.pig, water.pig,
     descent2.hog, descent2.ham, descent2.s11 and descent2.s22 data-files from
     your registered Descent 2 version in /usr/share/d2x/full;
     or in $HOME/.d2x-rebirth.
    </p>

     If you want to have the movies also add the intro-h.mvl, other-h.mvl and
     robots-h.mvl files to the dir.
